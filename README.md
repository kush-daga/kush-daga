Hi there! 👋
I’m Kush Daga, but you can call me dev_kid (I also answer to “Sir Code-a-lot” and “The Master of Divs” depending on my mood). I’m a full-stack web wizard by day, and a digital taco enthusiast by night. My interests include 3D animation, gaming, blockchain, and finance — because why not learn how to make money while riding a dragon through the Metaverse? 🐉💸

I’ve unlocked the “Successfully Centered an Element in CSS” achievement, and I’m here to help you do the same, but only after we spend 15 minutes questioning the existence of divs and whether they truly have a soul. 🙃
Oh, and I have a side gig building websites for squirrels — I call it "Squirrelify Your Site". 🐿️💻

More about me (a.k.a. the legendary backstory):
🔭 I’m currently working as ... Founding Engineer at Segwise, where we deconstruct the mysteries of the universe one line of code at a time. Last week I also accidentally programmed a time machine but let’s not talk about that (I was late for meetings for a reason).
🚧 I’m currently building ... Bugzy and Shundo with Tanvesh — an SDK that collects bugs, feedback, and queries like a digital vacuum cleaner powered by unicorn farts. 💨✨
🌱 I’m currently learning ... How to build a browser that will read your mind. One click and boom! It knows exactly which cat video you want to watch. 🔮
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ... Literally anything that involves code, memes, interdimensional time travel, or spaghetti.
🤔 I’m looking for help with ... SwiftUI. It’s like the ancient sorcery of app design, and right now it’s making me feel like I’m trying to cast spells with a broke wand. 🪄
💬 Ask me about ... React. Or just ask me anything and if I don’t know the answer, I’ll summon the Google Gods to search it with you. 🙏🔍
📫 How to reach me: ... kushdaga@icloud.com. But be warned, I might be typing on a typewriter while riding a unicorn at the same time. So response time is magically unpredictable. ⏳
😄 Pronouns: ... He/Him (but if I’m wearing my cape, it’s “Lord of the Code”)
⚡ Fun fact: ... Did you know array.some() in JS is like a magical “doppelgänger detector”? It’s like, “Hey, is there at least one clone of me in this array?” And if yes, party time. 🎉✨
My Work (the epic saga continues):
I mostly work with Frontend technologies like React, NextJS, and Svelte, but let’s be real, Svelte is like a haunted treasure chest — I’m pretty sure there’s treasure inside... but I don’t want to open it alone. I’m also fluent in TypeScript, the language that promises to catch all your mistakes... but only if you can read the ancient runes. 🧙‍♂️🔮

Current Work:
Fampay (Current Focus) - Joined as a Full-Time Frontend Developer. I’m currently helping 5 million+ users get their rewards, but sometimes I daydream about building an app that will also remind me to water my plants. 🌱💦

Templates I’ve Created (because I have too many ideas and not enough coffee):
NextJs, Prisma, GiraphQL, Apollo, GraphQL Helix - The Full Stack Template that will save you time, and probably also your soul
React, Redux, StyledComponents — The Ultimate Frontend Setup to make your app look like a digital fashion show
Private Work (don’t tell anyone I was involved, but these apps are actually secretly powered by fairy dust):
UrbanTV - I built a platform for live-commerce in India. Basically, you can buy things while a llama dances in the background. 🦙
Hallparty - A social media app for colleges and communities. We made sure that even if you’re stuck in a room with no WiFi, you can still party. 🎉
Fansee - Built a platform for celebrity experiences, where you can ask celebrities to read your fortune cookies. 📜✨
Projects I dream about finishing someday (like that unfinished sandwich I left in the fridge):
Swank: A documentation-based social media app where users earn points for getting lost in docs (because we’ve all been there). Think of it like Twitter meets Wikipedia, but with rainbows. 🌈✨
NotsApp: A WhatsApp-Notion integration. Now you can send messages to your Notion like it’s your personal diary... and your diary knows everything. 📝🔮
All other projects I’ve made (because I can’t stop coding even if I was locked in a room with 1000 rubber chickens):
Name	Link	Description	Language	Difficulty
CLIAS	GitHub	A CLI tool to add aliases to your zshrc file. Because your terminal deserves superpowers. ⚡	Go	Low
Viberrr	GitHub	A website to create playlists for events. Seriously, I’m one playlist away from world domination. 🌍🎶	T3 Stack, ChatGPT	Low
Crowdd	GitHub	A website to see how crowded places are. It’s like Google Maps but with more confetti. 🎉	Remix, Vercel, Prisma	Low
Wheel of Fortune	GitHub	Spin the wheel, but this time with confetti and pizza. 🍕🎉	React	Low
And more! But if you scroll down this far, I’m sending you a virtual hug and 10 pounds of glitter. Check out the rest here! 💖✨
